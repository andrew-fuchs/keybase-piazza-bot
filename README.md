# A Piazza Bot for Keybase

A proof of concept bot for [Keybase](https://keybase.io/) that responds
to a `!piazza <POST #>` command by fetching the relevant post from the
[Piazza](https://piazza.com/) e-learning Q&A platform and replying in
Keybase chat with a link and the first few lines of the post.

Keep in mind that this was written as a proof of concept, does not
gracefully handle every error that could occur, and thus should not be
considered production code.

Note for anyone looking through this code: the main entry point is in
[`keybase_piazza_bot/__init__.py`](keybase_piazza_bot/__init__.py)

## Dependencies

  * Python >= 3.7
  * piazza-api
  * pykeybasebot

## Development

### Dependencies, `requrements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt`

The file [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) lists the depencencies
needed to run the project.
[`dev-requirements.txt`](dev-requirements.txt) lists the dependencies
needed for development and testing. Both files can be passed to
[pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) using `pip -r`.

The [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt) and
[`dev-requirements.txt`](dev-requirements.txt) files are autogenerated
by [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools).

To add a new dependency update either
[`requirements.in`](requirements.in) or
[`dev-requirements.in`](dev-requirements.in) and then run `pip-compile`
on the updated file:

    pip-compile requirements.in
    pip-compile dev-requirements.in

To upgrade a specific dependency to a new version:

    pip-compile --upgrade-package <package name> requirements.in
    pip-compile --upgrade-package <package name> dev-requirements.in

Or, upgrade all dependencies with:

    pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in
    pip-compile --upgrade dev-requirements.in
